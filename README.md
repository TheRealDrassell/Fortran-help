# Fortran demos and concepts


Hi, I created this repo in order to help new comers at Fortran and for the [Fortran discord](https://discord.gg/tVYuwQcwg2), I am myself not the greatest Fortran coder, but I believe I can help others to get started at Fortran. 

I wrote all of my code on Fortran 90 and used gfortran as my compiler.

I will try to update this repo from time to time, adding new concepts and new demos as I continue to learn Fortran.
